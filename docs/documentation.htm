<h2><a name="i">Introduction</a></h2>
Welcome to Three-D Velocity, a real-time fighter jet simulation designed for people who are blind or visually impaired! This manual will give you a comprehensive look at what <abbr title = "Three-D Velocity">TDV</abbr> has to offer; by following the information in this manual, you will be on your way to obtaining full control of your aircraft, putting the power of the missiles, speed, and maneuverability at your fingertips.
<p />
Because this game is fast action--with maximum speeds clocked at mach 2, we highly recommend that you start off your flight experience by reading this manual. Links have been provided in the <a href="#contents">table of contents</a> to allow you to skip around the manual if you wish, but be careful not to miss the vital sections, which include the take off procedure, basic air combat maneuvers, and weapon descriptions. Remember, you will be flying an aircraft, not driving a car, so you will be in constant motion once you leave the runway.
<p />
<strong>Parental Advisory</strong>: Three-D Velocity contains mature language and scenes, and may not be suitable for minors.
<br />
<strong>Health Advisory</strong>: Due to the quick pace of this game, if you experience anxiety attacks, have motion sickness, or an abnormal heart rate, please consult your doctor before playing. Playing Three-D Velocity for long periods of time may result in dizziness, disorientation, ringing ears, anxiety, or increased heart rate. If you feel any of these symptoms, please turn off the game immediately and let the conditions pass.

<h2><a name="fc">Flight Controller</a></h2>
If you wish to play TDV using a flight controller, please make sure your controller has all of the following:
<ul>
<li>Rudder or twistable throttle stick: This mechanism is used to change your aircraft's <a href="#glossary">heading</a>. Turning the rudder left will turn the aircraft left, and turning the rudder right will turn the aircraft right. The aircraft will continue to turn until the rudder is centered. This will allow you to slowly circle your enemy if you wish to do so.
<p />
Note that the farther you turn the rudder, the harder the aircraft will turn. This is how you can perform sharp banks using the flight stick.
<p />
If your flight stick lacks a rudder, the throttle stick should be twistable. Twist the stick to the right to turn right, and left to turn left.</li>
<li>Throttle stick: The throttle stick is used for two operations: (1) Pulling back on the throttle stick will increase your <a href="#glossary">angle of attack</a>, and pushing it forward will lower it. This is also the stick that controls level flight. (2) Pushing left or right on the throttle stick is how you can control the <a href="#glossary">ailerons</a> and roll the aircraft.
<p />
Note that when controlling the aircraft with a flight stick, the pitch of the aircraft will coincide with the stick's position. Therefore, as soon as you begin returning the stick to center position, your craft will begin to level out; you do not need to wait for the aircraft to automatically level itself once you center the stick. The game will confirm this by saying "level" every time the angle of attack returns to zero degrees.
<p />
The farther left or right you move the stick, the harder the aircraft will roll. Because of this, it is recommended that you do not roll the aircraft too hard or you could lose sight of the enemy.</li>
<li>Directional Pad / View Finder: The directional pad (view finder) is used to change the view of the aircraft. The view finder can also be used to scroll through menus. Pressing up or left on the view finder will scroll backwards, and pressing down or right will scroll forward.</li>
<li>At least ten programmable buttons for aircraft functions. These buttons are customizable from within the game itself.</li>
<li>Speed Switch / Throttle Switch: this is not to be confused with the actual throttle. The speed switch / throttle switch is what will control your speed. Pressing the up arrow switch will increase your speed, and pressing the down arrow switch will decrease it. Alternatively, the flight controller may have a throttle lever. The throttle lever functions just like a throttle switch.</li>
</ul>
<p />
To use your flight controller, in the main menu, scroll down to "options", and select "change input device." You will be presented with a list of the current compatible devices the game detected. Press Enter on the device you wish to use.
<p />
If this is your first time selecting your flight controller for use, you will be taken through a few prompts to calibrate the controller to make sure the game can properly detect all of the buttons and switches. If you decide to change the settings on the controller later on outside of the game, please recalibrate your controller the next time you run the game.
<p />
During the calibration, the game will ask you to press a button to begin the process. Warning: Do not press a button that is on a movable device such as your throttle stick; instead, press a button on the flat surface of the pad. This is because the game expects the flight stick to be centered during calibration, and slightly moving the throttle stick when pressing a button could throw off the calibration procedure.
<p />
During the calibration, do not move the throttle stick, throttle switch, or rudder. Before starting the calibration, please make sure your rudder is centered. Not doing so could cause undesired results when turning.


<h3><a name="ufcm">Using a Flight Controller in Menus</a></h3>

You are able to use your controller to navigate any menu in TDV. Use the view finder to scroll up and down menus. The Fire button will activate an option, and the default switch weapon button, Button 2, is the exit button to get out of a menu.

<h3><a name="ffb">Force Feedback Support</a></h3>

"Force feedback" is the simulation of physical force through a hardware device. If your flight controller supports force feedback, congratulations! Three-D Velocity supports force feedback devices, and you will be able to experience the simulator better than ever. There is no extra configuration needed to turn on this feature--however, if you have turned it off from the device, you will need to reactivate it if you wish to use force feedback in TDV. At this time, there is no option available to turn off force feedback through the game; however, you can suppress it through your controller's configuration in the Windows Control Panel.
<h2><a name="gp">Game Play</a></h2>

The aircraft you will be flying is an F-29 fighter jet, which is a hypothetical jet created in this simulation only, and which is modeled after the F-16 fighter jet. The aircraft is designed to get you out of the tightest of situations, provided that you are willing to take risks and do not think for too long.

<h3><a name = "mainmenu">Main Menu</a></h3>
When you start Three-D Velocity, you will be presented with the main menu for the game. You can use your arrow keys to navigate through  the menu, and ENTER to select an option. Menus in TDV will wrap, so once you reach the bottom of the menu, you will be placed at the first option if you press DOWN ARROW or RIGHT ARROW from there, and likewise if you are at the top of the menu and press UP ARROW or LEFT ARROW, you will be placed on the last option in the menu.
<p />
You can also use the F6 and F7 keys to decrease and increase the music volume. These keys work in the main menu as well as in the hangar during online play. The volume keys can be remapped using the "Map keys" option.

<h3><a name="m">Modes</a></h3>

TDV comes with six different modes; Racing and Death Match Mode are meant for you to test fly and get a handle on the aircraft. They will not count against or in favor of your score.

<h4><a name = "trm">Training Mode (TM)</a></h4>

There are a lot of things to remember and do properly in TDV. For this reason, there is Training Mode. This mode will show you how to get airborne, maneuver, lock and fire. If you are struggling with the game, Training Mode will help you get used to the aircraft.

<h4><a name="rm">Racing Mode (RM)</a></h4>

This mode allows you to race another aircraft. Successful hits with weapons will do no damage, but will slow the target craft.
<p />
Listen for a buzzing sound which will be directional in your stereo field. This sound signifies that you are in a turn; you need to turn toward the sound to clear the turn. Once you do, the buzzing sound will stop and you will be on another straight path before the next turn. At the end of the race, each aircraft's rank will be given.
<p />
IMPORTANT: You can only turn when above the hard deck, so your first goal in RM should be to get to a safe altitude.
<p />
Note: If you cross the finish line but the game does not end, the other aircrafts are still racing. Be patient--they will reach the finish line soon.

<h4><a name="dmm">Death Match Mode (DMM)</a></h4>
This mode will allow you to engage another aircraft in dog fighting. You will need to use your skill of air combat maneuvering (ACM) to dodge missiles, bullets, and cruise missiles. At the same time, you will need to destroy the opponent craft.

<h4><a name="mm">Mission Mode (MM)</a></h4>

Mission Mode (MM) allows you to take part in the storyline of TDV. Before each stage of the story, you will be given details about it. You will start off with a racing simulator and will be required to race against other aircraft. Unlike the standard Racing Mode, in Mission Mode you could be racing against several aircraft. As you progress toward your goal of twenty points, the races will become more and more difficult. Your goal is to take first place in all races. You will be allocated points based on the number of aircraft you were racing against for the match.
<p />
After you complete the racing simulation, you will have to test your dog fighting abilities. The next stage will require you to use your skill of ACM to dodge fire from any number of aircraft. Note that the aircraft will also fire at each other in the easier part of the simulator. Just like the previous stage, the more you progress in this stage, the harder the fights will become. Once again, your goal is to get twenty points.
<p />
Once you pass both simulators, you will be allowed to participate in the storyline of the game. In the story mode, the vertical ranges for weapons, discussed later, will be increased. This is because you will be, more often than not, dropping missiles onto objects that are on the ground or in the ocean, so there is no need to vertically align with the target. If you happen to battle another aircraft though, you will once again need to vertically align your aircraft to get a lock.

<h4><a name = "apm">Auto Play Mode (APM)</a></h4>

In Auto Play Mode (APM,) all aircraft will be controlled by the computer. You will hear the match from Orion's perspective as always, but you will not be able to control any of his actions. This mode is similar to the arcade-style "self play" mode which would activate if the game was left alone for some time.
<p />
To activate APM, select "auto play mode" from the mode selection. You will then be presented with two options: <a href="#rm">Racing Mode</a> and <a href="#dm">Death Match Mode</a>. These options allow you to select which mode you wish for the computer to play.
<p />
When the match is finished, you will be returned to the main menu as usual. Selecting the mode selection menu again will revert the game back to the default setting--no APM.

<h3><a name = "to">Taking Off</a></h3>

Because TDV is a scaled down version of a flight simulator, you are required to manually get airborne. Follow the instructions in this section to do so.
<ol>
<li>When you select start flight, you will hear Captain Chase give you the go ahead. You can press a key to skip this transmission if you like.</li>
<li>Next, if you are playing RM or DMM, you will hear the AI craft throttling up to your right and soon take to the air; you can ignore this. Otherwise, you may or may not hear something based on what stage of the mission you are playing.</li>
<li>To throttle up, hold down Up Arrow. As your speed increases, you will start to hear the wind passing under the wings of your aircraft.</li>
<li>You are able to launch from a speed of 150 miles per hour. Press F2 to get your current <a href="#glossary">air speed</a>. Once you reach 150 miles per hour, hold down your Page Down key. You will hear a burst from the jets; in addition, you will hear an alarm start to sound. This alarm indicates that you are too low (viz. below the hard deck,) and you need to gain altitude. Your Page Down key will increase your <a href="#glossary">angle of attack</a>. The greater your angle of attack, the steepper the pitch of your aircraft will be and the quicker you will climb. TIP: do not start by climbing with a high angle of attack, or you will run the risk of stalling your aircraft because of your low air speed. The low-pitched, pulsing alarm is your stall warning alarm. When you first launch, you will naturally hear this alarm; you can ignore it for now. See <a href="#sc">the section on stall conditions</a> for more information.</li>
<li>As you climb higher, you will need to retract your landing gear to prevent drag on your aircraft. Below 1000 feet, the aircraft automatically locks the gear to prevent it from being retracted, should your aircraft have to unexpectedly abort the launch. Once you break the 1000 feet mark, press the retract landing gear button, which is G by default on a keyboard, and button 8 by default on a flight controller.</li>
<li>When the alarm subsides, let go of Page Down, and press Home to level your craft. You only need to press the level command once. Once you are level, the game will say "level." This means that your angle of attack is zero degrees.</li>

</ol>
<p />
<b>Warning</b>: The altitude warning alarm will also sound if you are too high in altitude, to the point where it becomes a danger to your aircraft's engine because of the thin air. If you are high in altitude and the altitude warning alarm sounds, you will need to dive to a safe altitude. You can check your engine's integrity rating by pressing ALT + F5. The percent you will hear is the current rating of your engine. If it reaches zero percent, your engine will explode.
<p />
When you dive to a safe altitude, the integrity rating for your engine will begin to increase. Therefore, we advise you to only go to an unsafe altitude if you wish to temporarily avoid incoming missiles. Other fighters will not follow your aircraft beyond the safe altitude.

<h3><a name = "ldg">Landing</a></h3>
There are several situations in which you are required to land your aircraft successfully. Either Captain Chase will ask you to land after successful completion of a simulator, or you will be driven to land on an aircraft carrier to replenish your aircraft. Please note that if you fail to land in the simulators, you will receive a point penalty, so it is vital that you master this concept; this is why you are able to practice in the simulations as much as you wish.
<p />
Landing is much more difficult than taking off, but the important thing to remember is that there is no harm in circling the runway a few times if you fear you are still too high in altitude or are coming in too steeply or too quickly.
<p />
When you are asked to land in the simulation programs, Captain Chase will let you know. The aircraft will automatically lock onto the landing beacon for you, and the pilot will confirm this by saying "locked on to landing beacon." Your targeting solution will function as normal at this point. Your goal is to line up the targeting tone so that you get a solid locking tone. Your aircraft is now aimed directly at the runway, which spans five miles in all directions from the beacon, which is in the middle of the runway.
<p />
Now that your aircraft is lined up with the runway, you will need to start gradually descending. If you are above the hard deck, you still have quite a way to go before you touch down; therefore, you can maintain a steep descent for some time. For the final landing, your angle of attack needs to be greater than -30 degrees, and your  speed must be 400 miles per hour or less (about 340 knots.) WARNING: do not press your speed brake to achieve a drop in speed right above the runway. Although you may successfully land, it could potentially damage your aircraft.
<p />
As you descend, you will need to monitor your altimeter to determine if you are low enough to take out your landing gear. The aircraft automatically locks the landing gear when you are above 1000 feet. Therefore, once you pass below the 1000 feet mark, the lock will be released, and you can press the retract landing gear button to take out your gear.
<p />
<b>Tip</b>: Remember that the targeting solution sounds only when an object is in front of you. Therefore, if you find that the solution has broken but you were aimed directly at the beacon, you may still be able to land.
<br />
<b>Tip</b>: To land on the runway, you need to be within five miles of the landing beacon; it does not matter if the beacon is behind you or in front of you.

<h3><a name = "lf">Locking and Firing</a></h3>

<h4><a name = "radar">Radar</a></h4>

TDV has two radars. The first is the locking radar which scans objects around you, and the second is the weapons radar which tells you about any missiles that have locked on to your aircraft.
<p />
Your radar is able to assist you in increasing the accuracy of your aim, or getting a readout of the objects around you. The higher your altitude, the more objects your radar is able to see. During your flight, it may be necessary to look around for certain objects, especially if their locations are not explicitly given; this is why we highly recommend getting familiar with the workings of the radar.
<p />
The radar will give you detailed information about an object. In the readout, you will be told an object's clock marking, their closure distance from you, and vertical distance from you.  To activate it, press L or Button 3 on a flight controller. You will be presented with a menu which contains all object that are visible to your aircraft. Pressing ENTER or the fire button will lock onto the object as discussed in the next section.
<ol>
<li>Clock Marking: This is what its name implies. The clock marking is the relative position of the opponent to your aircraft. Values of note are three o'clock--directly to your right; six o'clock-- directly behind you; nine o'clock--directly to your left; and twelve o'clock--dead ahead. <b>NOTE</b>: These values are approximations only, and may not be entirely accurate.</li>
<li>Closure: The closure distance is the distance between you and the opponent. When dog fighting, you will need to pay attention to this  value since different weapons have different ranges at which you are able to fire. For instance, the missiles can be fired from up to fifteen miles away, whereas you need to be much closer to get a lock with guns. In addition, if you are going for a lock and you are moving too quickly, you will run the risk of passing your opponent and will need to do a high-g turn to get another lock.</li>
</ol>
<p />
You will also be told the opponent's view (if necessary.) Your radar will give you one of three views:
<ul>
<li>Nose on: This view means that the opponent craft is facing your craft.</li>
<li>Tail on: This view means that the opponents tail is facing your craft.</li>
<li>Wing on: This view means that the aircraft is either parallel to you, or your velocity vectors are perpendicular to each other. For instance, if you were facing 000 and at coordinates (10, 10, 10) and the opponent was facing 090 at coordinates (10, 8, 10), the radar would report "wing on."</li>
</ul>
<p />
The weapons radar will scan around you and bring up a list of all projectiles that are targeting your craft. Activate the weapons radar by pressing R, or Button 9 on a flight controller.
<p />
Just like the locking radar, the weapons radar will tell you the relative position of any missiles it finds. For example, if an enemy fires a missile at your aircraft, a weapons radar readout may look something like
<blockquote>
Missile at 5:00, 2 miles closure, nose on, and 1,000 feet below.
</blockquote>
From this reading, you know that the missile is more or less behind you and is heading towards your aircraft--definitely not a good situation!

<h4><a name = "l">Locking</a></h4>

You can instruct the radar to home in on a specified object. This is called locking.
<p />
To lock on to an object, press the lock button, which is L by default on a keyboard and button 3 on a flight controller. You will be presented with a menu from which you may choose which object you wish to track. The objects which are nearest to your aircraft are at the top of the list. 
<p />
Pressing the lock button will notify the radar system which object you wish to track for a lock. Locks are not obtained automatically--you will need to explicitly tell the system that you intend to track a certain object. This will signal to the radar system to give you a target solution later on. Pressing the lock button again will break the lock. Please note that breaking a lock will not affect any active radar guided missiles already in flight. 
<p />
In addition to enabling your target solution, having an object tracked will allow you to get it's <a href="#radar">position</a> at any time. The radar will report your vertical distance from the target at regular intervals if you have an aircraft tracked and are climbing or descending, and the target solution will sound a distinct tone when you are within the vertical range that your current weapon can be fired from. Once you hear the tone, you can level out and work on getting closer to the enemy.

<h5><a name = "ae">Auto Elevation</a></h5>

An autopilot feature exists to assist you in getting vertically aligned with your target; this feature is referred to as "auto elevation." To activate auto elevation, press the "activate auto elevation" button, which is E by default on a keyboard, and button 11 by default on a flight controller. The aircraft will start to climb or descend, depending on the altitude of the target, and will attempt to align itself with the altitude of the target craft. This autopilot feature is useful if you are wanting to focus on only the heading of your aircraft and wish for the aircraft to take care of vertical distances.

<h5><a name = "tp">Target Position</a></h5>

There are two ways to locate objects in TDV. In the case of missiles coming toward your craft, you will need to listen for their directions and turn away to avoid them. You may also avoid your opponents this way, but they could be too far for you to hear them efficiently to dodge or shake a lock. For this reason, the status mode has been provided.
<p />
Once you have an object tracked, you can press F1 to hear the object's <a href="#radar">position</a>.

<h3><a name = "f">Firing</a></h3>

The weapons on your aircraft depend on your <a href="#radar">radar</a> for information. Each weapon has a different range at which it can be fired, since some of the weapons are simply free floating projectiles and others are equipped with a jet propulsion system. To fire a weapon, press the Fire button (Spacebar by default.) If you would like to increase your chances of hitting a target, or if you are wanting to aim at a specific target, the target solution can help you with this.
<p />
To obtain a target solution, track a craft by pressing L. Then, face the aircraft and head toward it. Once you are close enough, you will hear a series of beeps start to sound. Begin turning using your Left and Right Arrow keys so that the beeps get higher in pitch. Note that the target solution is directional; therefore, if you hear the target beeps in your left ear, you will need to turn left to face the target craft. Soon, you will hear a solid, constant tone. This tone signifies that you are aiming at the target craft.
<p />
Note: for forward firing projectiles, you are not guaranteed a hit. Because these projectiles do not follow a signal, they will travel in the direction at which they were launched and will never change course.

<h4><a name = "switch">Switching Between Available Weapons</a></h4>

Switching weapons is done differently depending on whether you are using a keyboard or flight controller. On a keyboard, use the numbers row to switch weapons. The number 1 will activate the guns, 2 will activate the missiles, 3 will activate the Laser Tag, and 4 will activate the Cruise Missile. Press the fire button to use your current weapon.
<p />
On a flight controller, there are no buttons with designated weapons. Instead, you press button 2 to cycle between available weapons. Press the fire button to use your current weapon.

<h4><a name = "wi">Weapons Information</a></h4>

Below, the specifications for each of the aircraft's weapons has been given. In the "Max. Firing Range" field, the first number indicates the maximum distance, horizontally, from which you will obtain a target solution. The second value indicates the maximum distance, vertically, from which you will obtain a target solution. For instance, if a weapon's maximum firing range was 10.0/200.0, you will obtain a target solution when you are within ten miles closure distance and two-hundred feet above or below the target.

<h5><a name = "g">Guns</a></h5>

Max. Firing Range: 4.0/300.0
<br />
Type: Forward firing
<br />
Engine: None--free floating
<br />
Description: These are standard fifty-calliber air-to-air or air-to-surface guns mounted on each wing of your aircraft.

<h5><a name = "m2">Missiles</a></h5>

Max. Firing Range: 15.0/300.0
<br />
Type: Forward firing / semi radar guided
<br />
Engine: Jet propulsion
<br />
Description: The missiles are explosive projectiles. They will explode on impact, so can do quite a bit of damage. They have a maximum travel range of about fifteen miles, so it is a good idea to use them if the opponent is getting away. Your aircraft has a total of eight missiles, with four on each wing arranged in a row. The pilot will confirm that a missile has been launched by announcing "Fox two," which is a code word signaling to ground command forces that an semi radar guided missile (viz. a missile which uses the launch platform's radar system to home in on a target) has been launched. Because this is a semi radar guided missile, the only time it will be directed toward the target is upon its first launch. After that, it will keep heading in that general direction and never change course.


<h5><a name = "lts">Laser Tagging System (LTS)</a></h5>

Max. Firing Range: 10.0/300.0
<br />
Type: Forward firing
<br />
Engine: Not applicable
<br />
Description: The Laser Tagging System, or LTS, tags an aircraft with a distinct signature. When you fire an LTS at an opponent, the RIO will let you know that you have tagged an object. the cruise missile, discussed next, uses the tag signature to follow its target.

<h5><a name = "cm">Cruise Missile</a></h5>

Max. Firing Range: 30.0/500.0
<br />
Type: Active radar guided
<br />
Engine: Jet propulsion
<br />
Description: The cruise missile must have a tag to follow before it can be fired. See the information on the LTS for more information. Because of the rocket fuel used to propel the missile, it is an explosive projectile. However, unlike the standard missile, the explosion is almost always guaranteed to take out the target craft. You are able to have only one cruise missile in flight at a time; you must wait for the missile to detonate before firing another one. The pilot will confirm that a cruise missile has been launched by announcing "Fox three," which is a code word signaling to ground command forces that an active radar guided missile (viz. a missile which uses its own radar system to home in on a target) has been launched.

<h5><a name = "inter">Missile Interceptor</a></h5>

Max. Firing Range: N/A
<br />
Type: Active radar guided
<br />
Engine: Jet propulsion
<br />
Description: The interceptor is fired at an incoming Cruise Missile and will try to get rid of it.

<h3><a name = "me">Maneuvering and Evading</a></h3>

In addition to locking and firing on an enemy aircraft, you will need to evade incoming missiles and gunfire. Your aircraft has several maneuvers to assist you in this task.
<p />
When you hear a missile coming toward you, you will need to turn away from it to prevent it from hitting you. All sounds in TDV are directional, so your goal is to position the missile's sound so that it is no longer on an intercept vector with your craft. In the next several sections, we will discuss the maneuvers available to you.


<h4><a name = "ttac">Throttling the Aircraft</a></h4>

Because the throttle works differently on a fighter jet compared to a ground vehicle, we advise you to pay close attention to this section. Remember, you are flying an aircraft, not driving a car (where speed change is almost instantaneous.) This concept may take some time to get used to--this is normal, especially if you have never dealt with an aircraft's throttle before; however, the more you practice, the better you will be at keeping your aircraft's speed under your control.
<p />
As you press the throttle up button, hold down the "up" switch on your throttle switch or push the throttle lever on your flight controller, the <a href="#glossary">rotations per minute (RPM)</a> of your engine will change. You can get your current RPM by pressing F2. As your engine speed increases, your air speed will also increase. Please be aware that your air speed is not necessarily dependent on your RPm; this fact is important, since neglecting it can lead to confusion later on. Your air speed represents the current actual speed of your aircraft, measured from ground perspective. Increasing the engine's RPM only gives your aircraft a greater thrust output; your aircraft will take time to accelerate to the new thrust level. This means that you are able to choke your engines, and still glide until you slow down enough to where you cannot remain airborne any longer.
<p />
Your engine's idle speed is 800 RPM. When you first start a game, your aircraft will slowly crawl down the runway. You can prevent this by pressing and holding the brake button.
<p />
As your air speed increases, you will begin to hear the wind pass under your wings. As you gain more speed, the wind will naturally get louder. WARNING: Do not depend on the pitch of your engine to gauge your current air speed; this is a common mistake and should be avoided. As mentioned previously, you could very well set your engine to 20000 RPM and still only be going thirty miles an hour.
<p />
Your aircraft has a maximum groundspeed of about 170 knots. Your aircraft's maximum air speed is mach 2. Note that without engaging your afterburners, you can only achieve an air speed of about 700 knots.
<p />
If you open your throttle fully, your <a href="#ab">afterburners</a> will automatically kick in. With the afterburners active, you can achieve a total air speed of mach 2--around 1500 miles per hour, about 1300 knots.

<h4><a name = "t">Turning</a></h4>

Before we discuss turning, let us discuss how an aircraft turns.
<p />
The aircraft can turn by applying rudder, or by banking. A rudder is a fin attached to the back of an aircraft which moves left or right, redirecting airflow. This creates drag, which turns the aircraft in the direction of the rudder. For instance, if you apply left rudder, the rudder will move to the left. Since the aircraft is always moving forward, the rudder extending to the left will create drag. Now that there is drag, there is an imbalance of forces, and the aircraft will turn left.
<p />
When you bank the aircraft, one wing will tilt upward and the other will tilt downward. This will create the necessary drag to turn your aircraft. In actuality, the rudder also moves to help coordinate the turn. The aircraft has a tendency to turn in the direction of the upward tilt--opposite of the bank direction. To prevent this problem, known as "adverse yaw," pilots must also turn the rudder to create necessary drag in the proper direction. In Three-D Velocity, the rudder is controlled for you automatically when you bank.
<p />
Two components describe the turn of an aircraft. The <strong>turn rate</strong> is the degrees-per-second turning rate of your aircraft. For standard rudder application, this value is generally three degrees per second. This means it will take two minutes and thirty seconds to complete a full circle turn.
<p />
The <strong>radius of turn</strong> is the radius of the circular path your aircraft takes while turning. This value is measured in feet, and increases as your speed increases. The faster your aircraft is going, the more distance it will have to cover per turn, increasing the radius.
<p />
Holding down the left or right arrow keys will gradually turn your aircraft by applying rudder in the specified direction. This method of turning provides the slowest turning mechanism available, and is useful when obtaining a solid locking tone, in which case turning too sharply could throw off the target solution, or put you in a direct path with a missile.
<p />
When using a flight stick, turning is achieved by moving the rudder, or twisting the throttle stick. Turning the rudder left will turn the aircraft left, and turning the rudder to the right will turn the aircraft right. Note that when using a flight stick, the aircraft will turn harder based on how much left or right the rudder is turned.
<p />
For a potentially sharper turn, you should bank your aircraft.

<h4><a name = "b">Banking</a></h4>

Your aircraft can also turn by banking. When you bank the aircraft, the <a href = "#glossary">Ailerons</a> will move, which will change your bank angle. The bank angle is the tilt of the aircraft measured from the right side of the craft. So if the aircraft is tilted down to the right, the bank angle is positive; and if it is tilted up (Viz. down to the left,) the bank angle is negative.
<p />
While you don't need to know the precise bank angle at any given time, getting a general idea of how sharply your aircraft can bank without stalling is a good idea.
<p />
When banking, you can change your heading quicker by increasing the rate of turn as well as decreasing the turn radius. The former can be done by banking more sharply, and the latter can be done by decreasing your air speed.
<p />
Use LEFT SHIFT + LEFT ARROW and LEFT SHIFT + RIGHT ARROW to change the bank angle of your aircraft. If you issue the Level command by pressing HOME, your Ailerons will return to neutral along with the Elevators.
<p />
On a flight stick, move the stick side-to-side to control the ailerons and bank your aircraft. You can control the turn rate more precisely by applying rudder as well as banking. Applying opposite rudder to the bank will slow the rate of turn, and applying rudder in the same direction as the bank will increase the rate of turn. This is one of many advantages to flying your aircraft with a flight stick versus the keyboard.

<h4><a name = "r">Rolling</a></h4>

Your aircraft can perform two rolls. These are the Aileron Roll, and the Barrel Roll.
<p />
The Aileron Roll uses the ailerons on your aircraft to roll about its longitudinal axis. You can think of this maneuver as "side-stepping," so it is a useful maneuver to evade bullets coming straight at you or to get out from an enemy's line of fire.
<p />
You can perform an Aileron Roll by setting your bank angle to ninety or minus ninety degrees (viz. your aircraft will stand on its wing.) Eventually, your aircraft will roll in that direction. You will now be flying inverted. We'll discuss this in a bit.
<p />
On a keyboard, use the Bank commands to change the bank angle of your aircraft to plus or minus 90 degrees. On a flight stick, move the stick to the far left or right extremities to roll the aircraft.
<p />
A Barrel Roll can be thought of as moving along one arc of a spiral. It is equated to the wheels of an aircraft moving along an inside edge of a barrel, hence the term "Barrel Roll." When you perform a Barrel Roll, the rate of turn for your aircraft will drastically increase. This is how you can turn very sharply.
<p />
Typically, you will only want to do a partial Barrel Roll, since a complete roll will rotate your aircraft 360 degrees and it will end up from where it started.
<p />
Executing a Barrel Roll involves pitching up at least thirty degrees, then banking at least forty degrees left or right. If executed successfully, your aircraft will change course much quicker than turning normally. Level your aircraft to come out of the roll.
<p />
You will hear the airflow in the direction of the Aileron or Barrel Roll.
<p />
On a keyboard, adjust your Angle of Attack by pressing PAGE DOWN, and then use the Bank commands to adjust your bank angle. Press HOME to level your aircraft once you have achieved your desired heading.
<p />
On a flight stick, pull back on the stick to pitch your aircraft upward, and bank by moving the stick left or right while you do this.
<p />
Your aircraft can also perform a loop. This will come in handy when we discuss the Split-S maneuver. In a loop, the aircraft rotates about its latitudinal axis (I.E. rolls in the direction of the nose or tail.) If you execute a loop, your aircraft will be inverted and will be facing the opposite heading than it was previously at. This is useful if an enemy is behind you and you can't get a quick enough turn rate to engage them.
<p />
To loop the aircraft, aim the nose vertically. Your Angle of Attack should be -90 degrees. Eventually, the aircraft will loop, and be inverted. You can achieve this on a keyboard by adjusting your Angle of Attack to -90 degrees by pressing PAGE DOWN or PAGE UP (if inverted.) On a flight stick, simply pull the stick back or push it forward to its extremity.
<p />
Because of the completely vertical moment of your aircraft before it loops, you should pay attention to your altitude before executing the loop. Pointing the nose downward while low to the ground, or pointing it upward while below the dead-air zone may prove to be fatal.
<p />
You are able to fly right side up or inverted. When inverted, your aircraft is upside down, so that your head will be closest to the ground. When inverted, all controls work in contradiction to their normal functions. For instance, if you changed your Angle of Attack to 90 degrees, you will dive instead of climb if you are inverted. Turning the aircraft left will turn it to the right and vice versa.
<p />
To bring your aircraft right side up again, simply repeat the loop. Inverting your aircraft is useful for turning around.

<h4><a name = "splits">Turning Around</a></h4>

You can most certainly perform a rudder or bank to <a href = "#glossary">yaw</a> your aircraft 180 degrees. However, this method is often time-consuming and you may be dead before you have a chance to fully engage the enemy. Your aircraft can perform a Split-S maneuver to quickly turn around.
<p />
Performing a Split-S involves looping the aircraft, then rolling it. It is recommended to roll first and then loop so you can immediately engage when you come out of the Split-S.
<p />
First, bank your aircraft with a bank angle of 90 or -90 degrees. Either one will work since all we want to do is invert the aircraft. At this point, your aircraft is still facing the original heading.
<p />
Next, loop your aircraft by pointing your nose downward. Your aircraft will loop and will end up being upright and facing the opposite heading from which it came. Congratulations! You've now performed a Split-S maneuver.
<p />
Note that the Split-S will change your altitude somewhat because of the pitch of the aircraft. Therefore, we do not recommend performing Split-S maneuvers when close to the ground, as the results can be catastrophic.

<h4><a name = "br">Braking</a></h4>

Applying the aircraft's speed brake will force the nose upward and drop your speed significantly. This allows for a sharper drop in speed than simply throttling down. To brake the aircraft, press Left Control.
<p />
When using a flight stick, the default brake button is button 7.
<p />
IMPORTANT: The brake button does not decrease your engine speed, it decreases your air speed. As soon as you let go of the speed brake, the aircraft will begin to accelerate.

<h4><a name = "ab">Afterburners</a></h4>

Sometimes it is necessary to not only outmaneuver the enemy, but also get away from them. Survival in a dog fight depends on your ability to maneuver, get in good shots, and also know when to flee. Your aircraft is equipped with afterburner jets to assist you in speed if you are being tailed.
<p />
There are two ways to engage the afterburners. If you open your throttle to full, the afterburners will kick in. Alternatively, you can hold down the afterburner button--A on a keyboard, or button 6 on a flight controller.
<p />
When the afterburners are on, your aircraft will accelerate much quicker than if the engine was running unassisted. This is because more fuel is used to power the engine and increase the net thrust output. 
<p />
When you open the throttle to full forward, you will be able to achieve the maximum air speed at which your aircraft can travel--1500 miles per hour. In addition, because of the quicker acceleration, you are able to get airborne in less time with the afterburners engaged.

<h4><a name = "sc">Stall Conditions</a></h4>

Your aircraft can give you two pieces of information that will be vital in avoiding a stall. These are your craft's <a href="#glossary">angle of attack</a>, and its <a href="#glossary">air speed</a>. A stall is caused by your aircraft losing lift, usually because of insufficient thrust, a <a href="#glossary">critical angle of attack</a>, or thin air. There is no textbook, perfect way to avoid stalling your aircraft; however, we can offer you this tip: do not climb or dive too steeply when your air speed is low.
<p />
The critical angle of attack is the angle of attack at which a stall occurs. You will hear a stall warning when your angle of attack is reaching critical, at which point you should level the aircraft.
<p />
Your RIO will tell you "we're too loose!" if you are in danger of stalling, and this message will be accompanied by an alarm. At this point, you should increase your air speed; this will hopefully give you enough lift to adjust your angle of attack and recover from a potential stall. If your aircraft does happen to stall, you will hear the stall alarm, which is a metallic whine.
<p />
When you hear the stall alarm, do not increase your angle of attack. A common misconception is that an aircraft always climbs or descends according to the direction of the nose. In actuality, a stall can be caused by a steep angle of attack, because air currents have nothing to buffet anymore. Instead, you need to focus on two things. The first of these is your speed. In most cases, increasing your speed will pull you out of a stall.
<p />
Once you see that your aircraft is increasing speed, try lessening your aircraft's angle of attack. As mentioned earlier, a high  angle of attack with not enough thrust will most likely stall your aircraft.
<p />
During a stall, since your aircraft has no lift it will begin to free fall. Due to the low <a href="#glossary">stability</a> of your aircraft (which is what gives it its maneuverability,) your chances of gliding are almost next to none. This is why your captain will continuously warn you to stay above the hard deck--you may have time to recover from a stall this way.
<p />
The rule of thumb in avoiding stalls boils down to three things: always have your aircraft under your control, Do not attempt to climb or descend too steeply, and do not attempt a rough maneuver if the stall warning alarm is on.

<h4><a name = "sectors">Sectors</a></h4>

In Three-D Velocity, a sector is defined as a field with a one-hundred ssquare mile area. Sectors along the longitudinal axis are designated by letters, while sectors along the latitudinal axis are designated by numbers. Therefore, traveling at a heading of ninety degrees will increase the letter designation for a sector. Eg. if the aircraft starts out in sector A0, and travels eastward, it will end up in sector B0. Similarly, traveling North--heading 0--will increase the numerical value of the sector. Eg. if the aircraft was in sector A0, it would end up in sector A1. The computer will announce a sector as your aircraft enters it.
<p />
The letter designation for a sector has the value A through Z. If an aircraft travels East from sector Zn where n is the numerical designation of the sector, the next sector would be ZAn. The designations would continue to ZBn, ZCn, ZDn, up to ZZn, at which point the designations would begin as ZZAn. Note that the rightmost letter must be at Z before another letter is added on. This format is important when you wish to autopilot to a sector.

<h5><a name = "vts">Autopilot to a Sector</a></h5>

An autopilot feature exists to point the aircraft in the general direction of a specified sector. To activate it, press the "autopilot to sector" button, which is N by default on a keyboard and button 13 on a flight controller. When prompted to enter a sector, type the sector to which you wish to travel and press Enter. The autopilot will confirm "vectoring to sector x" or, in the case of a nonexistent sector, "invalid sector."
<p />
The input format of a sector is important in this prompt. Continuing from the last section, keep in mind that the rightmost letter must reach Z before another letter can be added.
<p />
Examples of valid sector inputs are a20, z35, zb15, and zzzf65.
<p />
An input of aa30, zaz15, az2, or bbzd50 will not be accepted.
<p />
Also, take note of the spacing. When inputting sectors, there is no need to separate the letter and numerical designations with a delimiter. The autopilot will do this for you; you can simply type the letter and numerical designation as continuous input.
<p />
As soon as you manually alter the course of your aircraft by turning, banking, or performing a high-g maneuver, the autopilot will terminate its control of the aircraft. After you have completed your maneuver, you will need to re-enter the autopilot command to resume a path to the target sector.

<h3><a name = "oi">Obtaining Information</a></h3>

TDV provides several ways for you to get information about the objects around you, and instantly get your status.
<ul>
<li>Point of views: TDV has two point of views from which you may choose. The default, interior, means that you will hear objects from your aircraft's perspective. The external point of view means that you will hear objects from ground perspective, which is useful in Mission Mode since not all objects are airborne. You can press V to change the point of view, or press left on the view finder.</li>
<li>Radio Intercept Officer (RIO): Your RIO will inform you of significant warnings and keep you informed on other data throughout your flight. When the RIO says "spike!" this is a code word signifying that an enemy has obtained a partial or full lock on your craft. At this point, a soft, constant alarm will start to sound. The alarm will play until the lock is broken. Remember that for most weapons, the source craft must be facing the target craft, so the enemy is most likely behind you. You can perform some sharp banks or rolls to try and shake the lock.
<p />
When you hear an urgent message stating "We're too loose!" you are losing too much air speed, and are in danger of losing lift. This will cause you to fall like a rock. An alarm will accompany this message as well to help you stay aware of what your status is like.
<p />
Your RIO will also inform you when you make contact with an enemy craft with a weapon.</li>
<li>Commanding Officer (Captain Chase) Your commander, Captain Chase, will also have radio contact with you throughout your flight.
<p />
In Mission Mode, he will inform you of what race or death match you are starting or finishing, your total score, and also yell at you if you do not perform well during a flight. In addition, he will warn you of your altitude. If your altitude is below a certain range, an alarm will sound, urging you to pull up. Otherwise, you may not have enough time to recover from a stall or spin.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name = "status">Using the Heads-Up Display</a></h4>

Sometimes you will want to glance at your Heads-Up Display (HUD) to get real-time data about your aircraft. There are two ways to do this. The first way is by using commands that use the F1 through F5 keys on your keyboard. However, since there is so much information, or the Function Key designation for a particular piece of information may be difficult to remember in the height of battle, you can also press TAB, followed by a command. Doing this will put you in HUD Mode, where the next key you press will read some information.
<p />
We list the Function Key designation along with the HUD Mode designation for all HUD information. If you would prefer using the TAB method, you should press TAB first, then press the key listed in the column. When you do this, the game will say "status." This is how you will know you are in the HUD mode, and the next key you press will read some information from the display.

<h3><a name = "rearm">Refueling and Rearming</a></h3>

Three-D Velocity provides two ways for you to refuel and rearm your aircraft. This will be necessary during Mission Mode, especially because of the limited weaponry on board. To refuel your aircraft, press the "request refuel and rearm" key, which is F by default on a keyboard and button 14 on a flight controller. Pressing the key again will abort the dispatch and will call off the refuel.

<h4><a name = "refueler">Calling a Refueler</a></h4>

The mid air refueler is a refuel tanker designed to refuel and rearm your aircraft while in flight. To call the refueler, select "refueler" from the menu. As the refueler closes the distance between it and your aircraft, you will be notified by your RIO of this. Soon, it will turn around and head away from you. You will have to follow it, and get close enough to connect to the fuel boom.
<p />
Once the refueler is dispatched, you will have to be quick about connecting and getting refueled. If not, the tanker will bail because of low fuel, and you will be left stranded.
<p />
The refueler will restock your weaponry, and refuel your aircraft. In addition, it has the capability of repairing 30 percent of your aircraft's damage.
<p />
You are able to call the refueler a maximum of five times throughout your flight. Resources are limited, so you are advised to only call the tanker when absolutely necessary.

<h4><a name = "carrier">Landing on the Aircraft Carrier</a></h4>

You also have the option to land on an aircraft carrier to replenish your aircraft. To do this, select "aircraft carrier" from the menu.
<p />
The radar will automatically lock on to the aircraft carrier for you, and will not let you break the loc. To confirm that you really want to break the lock on the aircraft carrier, press the "refuel and rearm" key again.
<p />
Landing procedures here are different than they are for landing on a runway.
<p />
As you approach the carrier, you will be asked to acknowledge different distance markers. These are the 5.75 mile, 4.50, and 3.25 mile markers. However, to keep the transmissions brief, the transmissions will omit the integer values. This is a good way to know you are on course.
<p />
As with the standard landing procedure, the radar will report distances based on a point in the middle of the deck of the carrier. The carrier deck spans two miles in all directions, and the point is situated at sealevel. The deck of the carrier is 300 feet above the beacon, so you will have to be no more than 300 feet above the reported point by the radar to hit the deck.
<p />
You are able to land with a much greater speed when landing on a carrier than you are on a runway. For a successful landing, you must be traveling at 700 miles per hour or less (about 608 knots.) Do not forget to take out your landing gear as well.
<p />
Unlike the refueler, landing on the aircraft carrier will repair 100 percent of your aircraft's damage. Your weaponry will be restocked and your aircraft will be refueled.

<h5><a name = "catapult">Taking Off</a></h5>

Once your aircraft has been refueled and repaired, it will be catapulted off the deck of the carrier. If you do not gain enough thrust in time you will run the risk of stalling.

<h3><a name = "brawl">Brawling</a></h3>

Throughout the story, you will be required to engage in CQC (close-quarters combat) with other characters. Moves during these stages are fairly straightforward. Holding UP ARROW will move your character up, and holding DOWN LEFT or RIGHT ARROW will move your character in those respective directions. Pressing SPACEBAR will punch your opponent. You can grab your opponent by holding LEFT ALT. If you grab your opponent, you will hold on to them until you release the LEFT ALT key, at which point your character will throw the opponent. If you are standing near a wall or other object, the opponent may get thrown up against the wall or into the object. This will hurt them more.

<h3><a name = "cr">Command Reference</a></h3>

This section contains the default key command list for Three-D Velocity. The game allows you to map each of the keys listed below. However, when mapping keys for a flight stick, some keys are not mappable. The table below will indicate which keys can be mapped and not mapped.
<p />
Please be aware that some keyboard commands do not have flight stick equivalents. When a command does not exist for an assignment on the flight stick, the button assignment column will display a period (.) to indicate this.

<h4><a name = "mk">Mapping Keys</a></h4>

As mentioned above, most of the key assignments in TDV can be customized to your liking. This section discusses how to map keys, both with a keyboard and flight stick.
<p />
To map keys with the keyboard, select "options" from the main menu. Next, select "map keys," and then select "keyboard." You will be presented with a list of keys that are available for mapping. Note that if a key cannot be mapped, it will not appear in the list.
<p />
To reassign any of the key commands, press Enter on the key you want to map. You will be asked to press the "modifier" for the key. The modifier is the key that should be held down while pressing another key. For instance, in the default assignment of "bank left," the key command is Left Shift+Left Arrow, so the modifier would be Left Shift. The modifier does not have to be either of the Alt, Shift or CTRL keys; if you wish, you can assign an alphanumeric key as a modifier as well.
<p />
If you do not wish to provide a modifier, simply press Enter.
<p />
The next prompt tells you to press the key you would like to assign to the action. If you assigned a modifier, you will need to hold it down and press this key to initiate the action. For instance, if you were assigning the "bank left" action and you pressed Left Shift on the modifier screen, and Left Arrow on the key screen, you would have to press Left Shift along with Left Arrow to perform a bank.
<p />
To map keys with the flight stick, select "joystick or flight simulation controller" when asked what device you would like to map. You will be presented with a list of keys that are available for mapping. Note that if a key cannot be mapped, it will not appear in the list. When using a flight stick, you will notice that the key map menu has fewer keys to map. This is because several controls are mapped to the operation of movable devices on your flight stick and cannot be changed. Use the view finder to scroll up and down the key map menu, and press the fire button to select a key to map. Next, press the button on your flight stick that you would like to assign to the selected action.
<p />
Once you are finished mapping keys, press Escape to return to the options menu. Important: the key map is not updated until you Escape out of the key map menu.
<p />
You can also delete your custom key map. Select "restore default key map" from the key map menu to do this. This action <b>cannot</b> be undone.

<h2><a name = "config">Customization and Configuration</a></h2>
There are several options to allow you to customize Three-D Velocity to your liking. The first option, and one that is immediately available when you launch the game, is the options menu in the main menu. Selecting this option gives you the following choices:
<ul>
<li>Map Keys: This option allows you to change the key configuration for the game. See <a href="#mk">Mapping Keys</a> for more details. Changes made here will take effect immediately.</li>
<li>Change Input Device: If you choose to play the game with an alternate input device rather than your keyboard, such as a flight controller, selecting this option will allow you to make those changes.</li>
<li>Change Performance Options: In the newer versions of Three-D Velocity, some players may hear stuttering audio. This will be especially noticeable during cut scenes and in the background music. Selecting "Change Performance Options" will allow you to adjust resources in TDV. You are presented with three options in the "Are you experiencing audio stuttering?" prompt:
<ol>
<li>Yes, always: Select this option if you are running a fairly slow processor, and experience stuttering audio quite a bit. This option will consume more RAM; be aware of this if you have a small amount of memory (five-hundred and twelve megabytes or less.)</li>
<li>Occasionally: Select this option if you are running a fairly fast processor, but get audio stutters when running other processor-intensive applications, such as voice over IP programs or browser windows with flash animations.</li>
<li>No, there is no stuttering: This is the default option. Select it if you experience no audio stuttering. This option consumes the least amount of RAM, but is a bit heavier on the processor than the other two options.</li>
</ol>
Once you have selected an option above, the game will reset its resources, causing the main menu music to restart. This is normal and is not a fault with the game or the system.</li>
</ul>
<p />
Another method of configuration available to you is enabled during game play, and can be accessed by pressing the "Bring Up Game Options" key. When you do this, the following options are available:
<ul>
<li>Vertical Range Announcement: If "Relative Position Auto Trigger" is on, this option allows you to set how often the computer announces your vertical distance from a target. Otherwise, it will allow you to set how often the computer announces your altitude as you climb or descend.</li>
<li>Course Change Announcements: If "Relative Position Auto Trigger" is set to "on," toggling this option to "on" will tell the computer to announce a target's clock marking relative to your aircraft. Otherwise, the computer will announce the aircraft's heading as you yaw the aircraft.</li>
<li>Relative Position Auto Trigger: When this option is on, "Vertical Range Announcement" and "Course Change Announcements" will announce the aircraft's altitude and new heading when the aircraft yaws. However, the radar will use situational awareness and commands issued by you to change this behavior.
<p />
If the computer detects that your primary interest is to lock on to a target, instead of announcing your altitude, it will announce the vertical distance from your aircraft to the target. Further, instead of reporting your aircraft's new heading, it will report the clock marking of the target. If you wish to revert back to normal announcements, press TAB, and then a command which is not target-specific--for instance, pressing TAB and then A will cause the computer to revert.</li>
<li>Save Game: In Mission Mode, this option allows you to save a game and return to it later. In Story Mode, games are not saved automatically. Your game will be saved after you complete a session in the simulators.</li>
<li>Load Game: In Mission Mode, this option allows you to restore a saved game. This is applicable to Story Mode only.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name = "glossary">Glossary</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Ailerons: These are hinged extensions coming off the back of each wing. In a roll, the ailerons control the force of the air currents acting on each wing. The ailerons work in contradiction to each other and this is what helps the aircraft achieve the roll maneuver. For instance, if the aircraft was to roll left, the aileron on the left wing would be lowered, and the one on the right wing would be raised. In this manner, the force of the air on the right wing would lift the right wing up, and the force of the air on the left wing would force the left wing down.</li>
<li>Angle of Attack: The angle between the wings of an aircraft and a fixed reference point, which will be taken as the ground in Three-D Velocity. An angle of attack between 1 and 90 degrees will direct the force of relative air currents above the airfoil, producing lift. Similarly, an angle of attack between -1 and -90 degrees will direct the force of relative air currents under the airfoil, which will cause a downward pitch of the aircraft and cause the aircraft to dive.</li><li>air speed: The speed of the air passing under the wings of an aircraft.</li>
<li>Centrifugal Force: The outward force of a body moving around another body</li>
<li>Critical Angle of Attack: The angle of attack at which a stall occurs. The critical angle is typically between 60 and 120 degrees, and is always the same no matter the speed of the aircraft.</li>
<li>Heading: The compass mark of the direction of the nose, or front, of the object. In naval terms, headings start from 0 (due north) and progress in a clockwise motion. Therefore, 90 is due East, 180 is due South, and 270 is due West, The highest heading mark is 359, which is one degree mark to the left of 0.</li>
<li>RPM: Rotations per minute; used to identify the number of times an object rotates about its center in one minute. This value is often times also expressed as rotations per second (RPS.)</li>
<li>Sector: In Three-D Velocity, a sector is defined as a one-hundred ssquare mile area. Sectors along the longitudinal axis are designated by letters, while sectors along the latitudinal axis are designated by numbers. Therefore, traveling at a heading of ninety degrees will increase the letter designation for a sector. Eg. if the aircraft starts out in sector A1, and travels eastward, it will end up in sector B1. Similarly, traveling North--heading 0--will increase the numerical value of the sector. Eg. if the aircraft was in sector A1, it would end up in sector A2.</li>
<li>Stability: The stability of an aircraft determines how well it can maintain the current pitch and roll axis. An aircraft with a lower stability has a tendency to role more, which gives it more maneuverability; however, its chances of gliding when the engine malfunctions are slim. The lower the wings are on an aircraft, the higher its center of gravity and the less stable it becomes.</li>
<li>Yaw: Motion of an object such that its heading is altered.</li>
</ul>
